HOMEWORK 2

(Don't forget to create a github page.)

2-D grid with 5x5 rooms.
Agent's actions: Left, Right, Up, Down, Suck, and Do Nothing.

Performance measure:
* 4 point for each cleaned up room (changing the room from dirty to clean)
* -1 point for Left
* -1.1 point for Right
* -1.2 point for Up
* -0.3 point for Down
* -0.2 point for Suck
* 0 point for NoOp action
Over a lifetime of 10 time steps. Higher performance points are better.

Implement 4 algorithms:
* uniform cost tree search, up to search tree depth 10
* uniform cost graph search, up to search tree depth 10
* depth-limited depth-first tree search, with depth limit 10
* depth-limited depth-first graph search, with depth limit 10

Potential programming languages for the homework:
- C
- Python
- Ruby
- Haskell
- Crystal
